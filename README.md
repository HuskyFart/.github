# HuskyFart Games

HuskyFart Games is a passion project game studio. We don't take ourselves too seriously, hence the name.

## Ideals

1. **FOSS for life**
   * Our stack is consistently-tailored to ensure our worflow is entirely based on FOSS principles
2. **Linux first**
   * All of our games are developed (at least, by the lead developers) on Linux
   * All games work on Linux; "first-class" support
   * All games will work on other platforms as well, but Linux takes priority for us (specifically, Ubuntu distros)
3. **Pay it forward**
   * Since we're using things that are often less documented than larger commercial projects, we try to do what we can to pass things we learn along

## Preferred tech stack

1. Game engine - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
2. Modeling software - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
